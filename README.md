# Hand-Gesture-Controller
A Universal Hand gesture controller using Open CV and Google assistant API.

This project uses open cv to predict a hand gesture and then pushes the recognised gesture to Google Assistan API to control IoT devices.
Please install Google assistant SDK before using the modified text input program.
